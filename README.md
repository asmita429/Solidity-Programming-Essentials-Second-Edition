This is the code repository for [Solidity Programming Essentials  ](https://www.packtpub.com/product/solidity-programming-essentials/9781788831383), published by Packt.

**A guide to building smart contracts and tokens using the widely used Solidity language**


## What is this book about?
Solidity is a contract-oriented language designed to compile code for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This book will help you understand Solidity programming to build smart contracts for Ethereum and blockchain from the ground up. It will enable you to write robust, secure, object-oriented contracts that extend blockchain with business functionality.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Learn proven smart contract implementation challenges and solve them using Solidity
* Go deeper into Solidity to write effective upgradable and maintainable smart contracts using best practices
* Get to grips with the latest version of Solidity with updated codes and examples

All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
"pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
contract ConversionDemo {

 function ConversionExplicitUINT8toUINT256() pure public
returns (uint){
 ……
 }"

```
